I am a PHD student supervised by [Michael Greenspan](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/michael-greenspan.html) at [RCVLab](https://rcvlab.engineering.queensu.ca/), ECE, Queen's University at Kingston. I am currently working on a research project on the topic of 6DoF Pose estimation for robotics bin picking. My hobbies are traveling and traditional Chinese(indeed originally from Mongolia) instrument [Erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu).
